00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,540
<b>This is a Popeye cartoon.</b>

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,540
Popeye is <i>hilarious.</i>

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,240
The thing is, you have to pay close
attention to everything that Popeye says under his breath.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,560
That's where the real humor is.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,779
Sure, this public domain cartoon is full of
visual gags and plenty of physical comedy - 

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,359
that is to say, violence with no real consequences -

7
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,650
but for the adults who pay attention,

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,679
Popeye becomes even more rich with gags and wry humor.

9
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,649
Popeye is even given to leaning on the 
fourth wall on occasion.
